Rules to create a Red-Black tree:

	1. If the tree is empty, we create a new node as a root node with the color black.
	2. If the tree is not empty, we create a new node as a leaf node with the color red.
	3. If the parent of a new node is black, you exit.
	4. If the parent of a new node is red, check the color of the sibling of the parent.
		a. If the color of the sibling is black, perform rotations and re-coloring
		b. If the color of the sibling is red, re-color the nodes. Then check whether the parent's
			parent of the new node is the root node or not. If it is not a root node, re-color and 
			re-check the node.
